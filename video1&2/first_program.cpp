//C++ language was developed in 1979 by bjarne stroustrup
//Fast program , more control over the system resources , memory management
//High Performance
//Major updates of C++ :
    //2011 -> C++ 11
    //2014 -> C++ 14
    //2017 -> C++ 17

//Basic structure of C++ program

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout<<"Hello World!";
    //std::cout<<"Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

//#include<iostream> -> Header File(increase the program speed ) -> It helps in input /output -> cin ,cout -> More functions are there
//int main() -> int is the data type and main is the function from where the program begins -> program always starts from the main
// To not use std::cout at every line we just write -> using namespace std;
//return 0 means successful termination of the program
